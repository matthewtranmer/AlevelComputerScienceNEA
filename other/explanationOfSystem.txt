The client the performs an X3DH with the pre key bundle. 

The pre key bundle contains: 
The public identity key,
The public signed pre key and the
The ephemeral pre key

Once the client generates the root key, it should generate a key pair, perform a diffie hellman and create a new chain key.  

The chain key will then be used to derive the next chain and then the message will be encrypted.

The client then will upload the encrypted message, the chain key, the private key



PROBLEM TO SOLVE:
how do we know if its the first message in a chain or not.

LOGIC FOR SENDING MESSAGES
Every time the first message in a chain is sent, they need to generate a new key pair.

No Messages Whatsoever
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the chain keys table isn't populated with any of the conversations then return a pre key bundle. 
The client will then generate X3DH constant, a key pair and then will encrypt their message.

The client will return the encrypted message, the rachet private key, the rachet public key and the
public ephemeral key.

The server will then populate the X3DH handshake table. The "is next message in chain" flag should be
set to true after this. The other parties flag should be set to false.



Sending The First Message In A Chain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send the client the chain key and the other parties public key.

The client should then generate a new key pair, and then generate the encrypted message. 

The client will return the encrypted message, and the private key.

The "is next message in chain" flag should be set to true after this. The other parties flag should
be set to false.


Sending A Message Within A Chain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send the client the chain key and the sequence count.

The client will then encrypt the message.

The client will then return the encrypted message.



LOGIC FOR RECIEVING MESSAGES

Recieving The First Message Ever
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send the client the senders public X3DH values which consists of: the public identity key, the public
ephemeral key. Also, send the client the pre-key identifier and the time the message was sent.

The client will then decrypt the message and display it. After this, the client will then upload the 
the encrypted message to the server so that it can be stored in the old messages table.



Receiving The First Message In A Chain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send the client the encrypted message, the private key, the chain key and the other parties public key.

The client will then decrypt the message and display it. The client will upload the new chain key to the
server. After this, the client will then upload the encrypted the encrypted message to the server so that
it can be stored in the old messages table.



Recieving A Message Within A Chain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Send the client the encrypted message, the chain key and the sequence count. 

The client will then decrypt the message and display it. The client will upload the new chain key to 
the server. After this, the client will then upload the encrypted the encrypted message to the server
so that it can be stored in the old messages table.
